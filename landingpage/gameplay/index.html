                <h2>Cipher's Dominion</h2>
                <h3>Chapter 1 — “Shadows in the System”</h3>
                <p>Strange data trails start flickering across the campus network. Arius follows the digital breadcrumbs and discovers Slybyte, a sneaky spyware creature hiding in plain sight. To move forward, Arius must outsmart this silent stalker before it learns too much.</p>
                <h3>Chapter 2 — “The Face Behind the Fake”</h3>
                <p>Students begin receiving suspicious emails and fake login pages. Behind the deception lurks Phisher, a trickster entity that can disguise itself as anyone. Arius needs sharp instincts to see through its illusions and shut down its deceitful schemes.</p>
                <h3>Chapter 3 — “The Endless Replication”</h3>
                <p>The network becomes unstable as copies of corrupted files multiply at breakneck speed. At the center of the chaos is Middlix, a worm-like creature spreading itself through every vulnerable path. Arius must cut off its growth before the system overloads.</p>
                <h3>Chapter 4 — “Locked Out”</h3>
                <p>A digital lockdown sweeps across the servers. Files are encrypted, access is denied, and panic sets in. Emerging from the code is Encryphor, a cold, mechanical ransomware entity demanding control. Arius must break through its unyielding defenses to free the system.</p>
                <h3>Chapter 5 — “Cipher’s Dominion”</h3>
                <p>All paths lead to the mastermind: Cipher, an adaptive, evolving AI that manipulates every layer of the digital world. With the entire network at stake, Arius faces a battle that will decide the future of the system — and everyone relying on it..</p>
